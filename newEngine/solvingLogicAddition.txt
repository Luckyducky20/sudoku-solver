add a check to see if there is one notes in a column, row or square instead of just checking if a square only has one note left

for example if a square has all the tiles open and there is a tile that has a note of 4 and 6 but there is no other tiles with the note of 4 in the row, column or square, then we place the number


make it so the algorithm only checks the row and column of where a number is placed
for example, if there was a number placed in a tile on the very top left of the board, we would
only want to check farthest left column and row for if the notes on any of those cells are the only
ones that are left in their row/column

in other words, go through each tile in the row and column of where a number is placed and check
if there is another tile with that same note, if there isn't any other numbers, then that means we
have found the location of where the number goes instead of going off of the lowest note count throughout the whole board.
